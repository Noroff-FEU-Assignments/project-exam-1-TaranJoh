Chapter and Verse is a blog containing book reviews and recommendations, targeted at avid readers bonded by a thirst for great stories.

## Description

This is a blog site for an imagined bookblog called Chapter and Verse. Designing and creating it was my exam for the front-end course at Noroff School of technology and digital media.

Its core target audience is adults that enjoy reading and are proficient in the use of modern technology.

The website includes these pages:

- Home (including a carousel that displays blog posts from an API)
- About
- List of blog posts
- Blog post specific page (with image modal)
- Contact (with form validation built with JavaScript)

The blog content is stored on a headless WordPress installation, and is fetched through WordPress REST API.

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
